# Scanning-tips
## SCANNING

Scan at the highest DPI you can, output with a lossless format (TIFF, PNG...).<br>
Make sure to crop your debinded pages within your scanner's software if it's supported, according to your page's original aspect ratio.<br>
Else, batch crop with IrfanView.<br>
If the colours of the output seem off, you may auto-balance the brightness and saturation, but NOT the leveling.<br>
You may want to use the filters however you want, as long as it's not too much. (note: filters can be applied within photoshop during the editing process, so we can get clean files).<br>
